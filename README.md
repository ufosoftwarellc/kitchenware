# Kitchenware
My entries for the [Data Talks Club Kitchenware Image Classification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kitchenware-classification)

The goal of the competition was to classify images of kitchenware items into 6 classes:
	- cups
	- glasses
	- plates
	- spoons
	- forks
	- knives

- Experiments with Effiecentnet using TensorFlow and Keras
	- learning rates
	- l2 regularization
	- using different versions of the Effiecentnet
- Utilized synthetic data to even out class imbalance
- Incorporated [imgaug](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
	- to generate synthetic data
	- improve training by presenting the neural network with variations of the training images
